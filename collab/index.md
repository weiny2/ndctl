## v6.6 Queue
* RCH Error handling
  * Terry working on it right now. Was waiting on response from Dan which should be there yesterday.
  * Will pick that work back up

* Type2
  * Davidlohr to submit the fix for type2 init collision. (Merged)
  * Dan rebasing patches.  There is conflict here with the Switch CCI work.  See below.

* DCD 
  * Ira is reworking the patch set quite a bit.
  * Fan’s QEMU DCD work is being used
  * Cxl-test being added for better regression testing
  * Cxl-test event processing was changed
  * New DAX device work needed to handle sparse extents within the dax region
  * Interleaving is in the back of his head and Navneet has been looking into this. However, interleaving is not slated for this initial work
  * Jonathan - concerned that interleaving should not to be precluded
  * Leave in comments about where interleaving would fit in.
  * Interleaving is the next major feature…
  * QEMU - DCD merge would be at least 6.7 aligned.

* Switch CCI (Jonathan)
  * Opens around what we do for user space – almost every command is destructive
  * Maybe just CXL raw commands are required?
  * Patch set has been a pain to rebase on type 2 from Dan
  * Would really like review / feedback
  * Davidlohr would like to merge the ‘moving around code’ sooner
  * Would help with the type 2 conflicts
  * It is hard to generalize the code without this second user
  * Not critical for 6.6
  * would like to see an early merge slated for 6.7
  * In the end – Security questions are major gating factor

* Memory tiring in general
  * CDAT vs HMAT
  * ‘Distance’ calculations vary
  *  Patch set: ‘Mem tiring calculating abstract distance from ACPI’ (v6.7 material)

## FM general topics
  * We said we would talk about FM things in this meeting…
  * Is there something at plumbers?  Yes there is.
  * Plumbers BoF for FM stuff?
	
## Question from discord:
* John: "numa ratio policy patch?"
  * Jonathan will try and dig in to see where the patches are
  * We are talking at a VMA level.

* memory_failure() for CXL events
* Maintenance Feature Support (DRAM PPR) (BMC only?)

## Notes
* Question about kernel code modularity for accelerator drivers
  * Expectation is that it is a bug if CXL core code cannnot be reused for devices outside of the class-device definition
* DCD Sharing may be the first user of HDM-DB functionality in the kernel, QEMU model for this in scoping
* Multi-head (not yet MLD) device support in the works for QEMU
* QEMU gaining a fix for clearing the HDM decoder COMMITTED bit when deactivating decoders
* Poison
* Poison inject can be done unconditionally, rely on "injected" indication to delineate real vs simulated hardware problems
  * open question: should the driver taint the kernel on inject? No, ACPI EINJ does not
  * Poison list: emit trace event on inject event? Maybe already covered by another event record
