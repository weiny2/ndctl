include::xable-no-op.txt[]

OPTIONS
-------
<memory device(s)>::
include::memdev-option.txt[]

include::bus-option.txt[]

-f::
--force::
	DANGEROUS: Override the safety measure that blocks attempts to disable
	a device if the tool determines the memdev is in active usage. Recall
	that CXL memory ranges might have been established by platform
	firmware and disabling an active device is akin to force removing
	memory from a running system.

-v::
	Turn on verbose debug messages in the library (if libcxl was built with
	logging and debug enabled).
